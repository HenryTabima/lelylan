# Lelylan. Open Source Internet of Things


Lelylan is an IoT cloud platform based on a lightweight microservices architecture.

The Lelylan platform is both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic. This means that you can connect any hardware, from the ESP8266 to the most professional embedded hardware solution and everything in between - and it can run on any public cloud, your own private datacenter, or even in a hybrid environment, whether virtualized or bare metal.

### Notes

This repository defines the architecture documentation. Check out the [microservices list](https://github.com/lelylan/lelylan#development) for the code implementation.


### Why Lelylan

Research in the Internet of Things is global and growing fast, but lacks the standard tools. Many companies are building their own solutions. By sharing what we have learned during the years, we want to create a shared code base with a clear focus on developers. To see Lelylan in action checkout the [tutorials](http://dev.lelylan.com/#overview-tutorials) in the dev center.


### Resources

* [Architecture](http://dev.lelylan.com/architecture) (request life cycle)
* [Internet of Things API](http://dev.lelylan.com/api) (how it works)
* [Blog](http://lelylan.com) (latest from the community)



# Getting Started

### Requirements

Lelylan is tested against

* Ruby MRI ~1.9.3
* Node ~0.8.8
* MongoDB ~2.6
* Redis ~2.6

(remember to run the `mongod` and `redis-server`)

## Setup

* [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)
* [Install Redis](http://redis.io/download)


## Installation

### Development

Lelylan is composed by different microservices.
Follow the installation guidelines for each of them.

| Microservice  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [API Proxy](https://github.com/lelylan/api-proxy) | Proxy API |
| [Devices API](https://github.com/lelylan/devices)  | Device monitoring and control |
| [Types API](https://github.com/lelylan/types) | Device type structure |
| [Subscriptions API](https://github.com/lelylan/subscriptions) | Realtime subscription |
| [Profiles API](https://github.com/lelylan/profiles) | Profile information |
| [OAuth 2.0](https://github.com/lelylan/people) | User authentication and authorization  |
| [Physical Proxy](https://github.com/lelylan/physicals) | Forward requests to the physical world |
| [MQTT Node](https://github.com/lelylan/nodes) | Forward and receive MQTT requests |
| [MQTT Server](https://github.com/lelylan/mqtt) | MQTT server/broker |
| [Webhooks](https://github.com/lelylan/webhooks) | Realtime HTTP notification |
| [Websockets](https://github.com/lelylan/websockets) | Full-duplex communication over TCP |
| [Dev Center](https://github.com/lelylan/dev) | Lelylan Dev Center |
| [Devices Dashboard](https://github.com/lelylan/devices-dashboard-ng) | Lelylan Devices Dashboard |
| [Types Dashboard](https://github.com/lelylan/types-dashboard-ng) | Lelylan Types Dashboard |

You can now access the [APIs]((http://dev.lelylan.com/api)) from `http://0.0.0.0:8200` (API proxy URL).

#### Development Environment Variable

During deployment, every microservice needs to be set to the following environment variables (remember to change them with your own microservices, mongodb, redis and cache URLs).

| Environment Variable | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `RACK_ENV=development` | Development rack environment |
| `RAILS_ENV=development` | Development rails environment |
| `NODE_ENV=development` | Development node environment |
| `LELYLAN_API_URL` | Api Proxy microservice URL |
| `LELYLAN_API_HOST` | Api Proxy microservice URL |
| `LELYLAN_DEV_URL=dev.lelylan.com` | Dev Center microservice URL |

We are studying solutions such as Docker, Mesos, and Ansible to simplify the installation process. If you are experimenting in the same area get in touch with [lelylan team](http://dev.lelylan.com/api).

#### Docker Development Installation
- Configure environment variables in docker-compose-dev.yml
- Run docker compose
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
```

##### Use subdomains for all microservices

###### Sed to replace domains
```bash
sed -i '/VIRTUAL_HOST/ s/$/.lelylan.com/' docker-compose-dev.yml
sed -i '/DEFAULT_HOST/ s/$/.lelylan.com/' docker-compose-dev.yml
sed -i '/PUBLIC_URL/ s/$/.lelylan.com/' docker-compose-dev.yml
sed -i '/LELYLAN_DEV_URL/ s/$/.lelylan.com/' docker-compose-dev.yml
sed -i '/PUBLIC_HOST/ s/$/.lelylan.com/' docker-compose-dev.yml
sed -i '/LELYLAN_PROXY_URL/ s/$/.lelylan.com/' docker-compose-dev.yml
sed -i '/LELYLAN_API_HOST/ s/$/.lelylan.com/' docker-compose-dev.yml
```

## Roadmap

The Roadmap provides the description of the items that the project has decided to concentrate on. It should
serve as a reference point for Lelylan contributors to understand where the project is going, and
helps to determine whether a contribution could be conflicting considering the future goals.

The fact that a feature isn't listed here doesn't mean that a patch for it will automatically be
refused (we also miss important things). We are always happy to receive patches for new cool features that we haven't
thought about, or didn't consider as a priority. Nevertheless understand that such patches might take longer for us
to review.

Checkout the [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) to see our near future goals.
